# Campaign_Website

Over the last few years I have successfully organised and ran through to completion multiple games of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. While running
multiple campaigns it can be difficult to organise and manage all of the information. To mitigate this I have attempted to create a Campaign Management Website.

This prototype is intended to do the following:

- Be a central hub for players to find information regarding the campaign they play in
- Allow players to create their own character sheet on the web page
- Provide a location for campaign rules to be stored for easy reference by players
- Provide an easy to access schedule of games.
- Allow contact to be made directly to me via a contact page which prodcues a unique text document for me to work through.
- Allow for session reviews to be posted regarding the campaigns players are playing in.

I am focusing on back-end development practice via this project at present using Flask and related libraries. Once I have completed the back-end development of
the website, and I have become familiar with JavaScript, I will begin work on the front-end functionality. At current I am using Bootstrap 5 for the small amount of
front end functionality on the website.
